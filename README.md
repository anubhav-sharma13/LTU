This paper consists of a thorough analysis of the **Mongolian Language** and its key features.
<p>The basic idea is to analyse them against the language universals (features which are found common across some major sections of languages).<br> As a part of analysis, to collect information, 3 approaches were taken :<ol> 
<li>Web Resources </li> 
<li>analysing ’Uregdseniig huleegch’(a Mongolian Short Film) </li>
<li>Conversation with the local dialect speaker </li>
</ol>
The findings have been presented after the complete analysis from all modes.</p>

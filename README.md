This paper consists of a thorough analysis of the **Mongolian Language** and its key features.
<p>The basic idea is to analyse them against the language universals (features which are found common across some major sections of languages).<br> As a part of analysis, to collect information, 3 approaches were taken :(1) Web Resources and (2) analysing ’Uregdseniig huleegch’(a Mongolian Short Film) (3)Conversation with the local dialect speaker . The findings have been presented after the complete analysis from all modes.</p>
